        <ol>
            <li class="pop"><strong>Make garlic rice</strong></li>
            <p>Before starting, wash and dry all produce. Heat a medium pot over medium heat. 
                When hot, add 1/2 tbsp oil (dbl for 4 ppl), then rice and half the garlic puree. 
                Cook, stirring often, until fragrant, 2-3 min. Add 1 1/4 cups water and 1/8 tsp salt 
                (dbl both for 4 ppl) and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low. Cover 
                and cook until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, 12-14 min. Remove pot from heat. 
                Set aside, still covered.
            </p>
            <li class="pop"><strong>Prep</strong></li>
            <p>While rice cooks, core, then cut pepper into 1/2-inch slices. Roughly chop spinach. 
                Roughly chop cilantro.
            </p>
            <li class="pop"><strong>Cook peppers</strong></li>
            <p>Heat a large non-stick pan over medium high heat. When hot, add 1/2 tbsp oil 
                (dbl for 4 ppl), then peppers. Cook, stirring often, until tender-crisp, 3-4 min. 
                Season with salt and pepper, then transfer to a plate.
            </p>
            <li class="pop"><strong>Cook chicken</strong></li>
            <p>Pat chicken dry with paper towels. Cut into 2-inch pieces. Season with salt, pepper 
                and half the Indian Spice Mix. Heat the same pan over medium. When hot, add 
                1/2 tbsp oil (dbl for 4 ppl), then chicken. Cook until golden-brown, 2-3 min per side.
                (TIP: It's okay if chicken doesn't cook all the way through in this step!)
            </p>
            <li class="pop"><strong>Make sauce</strong></li>
            <p>
                Add remaining Indian Spice Mix and remaining garlic puree to the pan with chicken. 
                Cook, stirring often, until fragrant, 30 sec. Reduce heat to medium-low, then add 
                tikka sauce and coconut milk. Cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce is slightly 
                thickened and chicken is cooked through, 5-7 min. Add peppers and spinach. Season 
                with salt and pepper, then stir until spinach wilts, 1-2 min.
            </p>
            <li class="pop"><strong>Finish and Serve</strong></li>
            <p>
                Fluff rice with a fork, then stir in half the cilantro. Divide rice between plates. 
                Top with chicken, veggies and sauce. Sprinkle remaining cilantro over top.
