        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prep</strong></li>
            <p>Before starting, preheat the oven to 450°F. Wash and dry all produce. Halve tomatoes. 
                Roughly chop parsley. Zest, then juice half the lemon (whole lemon for 4 ppl). 
                Cut any remaining lemon into wedges. Grate one-third of cucumber directly into a 
                small bowl. Stir in ¼ tsp garlic salt (dbl for 4 ppl). Thinly slice remaining 
                cucumber.
            </p>
            <li><strong>Cook turkey</strong></li>
            <p>Pat turkey dry with paper towels. Season with 1/2 tsp garlic salt (dbl for 4 ppl) and 
                pepper. Heat a large non-stick pan over medium-high heat. When hot, add 1/2 tbsp oil 
                (dbl for 4 ppl), then turkey. Cook until golden-brown, 1-2 min per side. Transfer 
                turkey to a baking sheet. Bake in the middle of the oven until cooked through, 10-12 
                min.
            </p>
            <li><strong>Warm pitas</strong></li>
            <p>While turkey cooks, arrange pitas on another baking sheet and bake in the top of the 
                oven until heated through, 3-4 min.
            </p>
            <li><strong>Make tzatziki</strong></li>
            <p>While pitas bake, drain liquid from grated cucumber then return cucumber to the small 
                bowl. Add yogurt, lemon zest, half the parsley, 1/4 tsp sugar to bowl with cucumber. 
                Season with pepper, then stir to combine.
            </p>
            <li><strong>Make chopped salad</strong></li>
            <p>Whisk together lemon juice, remaining garlic salt, 1/2 tsp sugar and 1 tbsp oil 
                (dbl both for 4 ppl) in a large bowl. Add spring mix, sliced cucumbers, tomatoes and 
                remaining parsley. Season with pepper, then toss to coat.
            </p>
            <li><strong>Finish and serve</strong></li>
            <p>Thinly slice turkey. Divide pitas between plates, then spread tzatziki over pitas. 
                Top with turkey and some chopped salad. Sprinkle feta over top. Serve remaining salad 
                on the side. Squeeze over a lemon wedge, if desired.
